<h1> <font face = arial> World Wide Web News November 1992 </font> </h1>
<hr>
<p> <font face = georgia> (As usual, this is distributed in plain text form, but the original hypertext contains lots of links and may be read as http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/News/9211.html. If you don't have World-Wide Web software yet, telnet to info.cern.ch (128.141.201.74), and select information about the WorldWide Web.)
</font> </p>
<h2> <font face  = arial> Client Software </font> </h2>
<p> <font face = georgia> Three developments on the clients side. Tony Johnson of Boston University, developer of the MidasWWW browser for Motif, has ported it now to four X11 platforms and has a tar file of sources available on ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/src or ftp://freehep.scri.fsu.edu/freehep/networking_news_email/midaswww as midaswww_1.0.tar.Z Tony also has plans to include graphics and text editing in the future.
<p> Here at CERN, Nicola Pellow is back until the end of the year, and has picked up the Mac Browser . She has a pre-alpha with basic functionality up, watch this space for the first release.
<p> The full-screen client (using curses) has been released by Jim Whitescarver of NJIT, see release note for details.
<p> The NeXTStep client has been revised. The 0.13 version generated bad SGML at times, so anyone using it to write hypertext is advised to upgrade to 0.14 immediately. The binary is in ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/bin/next/WorldWideWeb_0.14.app.tar.Z
</font> </p>
<h2> <font face = arial> Collaboration </font> </h2>
<p> <font face = georgia> We encourage collaboration by academic or commercial parties. There are always many things to be done, ports to be made to different environments, new browsers to be written, and additional data to be incorporated into the "web". There have already been many contributions in these terms, and also with hardware support from manufacturers.
<p> If you may be interested in extending the web or the software, please mail or phone us.
</font> </p>
<h2> <font face = arial> More and More Hypertext on Line </font> </h2>
<p> <font face = georgia> New W3 servers have appeared at KVI ad at CWI both in the Netherlands, IN2P3 in France, and NCSA in Illinois, USA. KVI and IN2P3 are both High Energy Physics institites. All the servers have local information as well as various other goodies.
<p> CWI has a hypertext version of the Gnu documentation and of a guide to Audio formats , and NCSA has many things including hypertext documentation for the X-Collage system. Two CERN projects to produce online hypertext documentation recently are ADAMO and RD13.
<p> Meanwhile, Cornell Law school have a server with hypertext of US Copyright Law... as law tends to be mostly cross-reference ("as defined in Sect1.2.2.(a) above") hypertext makes a lot of sense here!
</font> </p>
<h2> <font face = arial> Browse the WAIS Servers </font> </h2>
<p> <font face = georgia> It's sometimes been a bit difficult browsing through what there is in the WAIS world. Now, looking for information under "types of server" on the web will lead you to hypertext lists of WAIS servers arranged by name of "source" and by internet domain. These lists are generated automatically at CERN from TMC's catalogue. Clicking on the source name takes you directly to the index. Currently there are 310 databases on 88 hosts accesible.
